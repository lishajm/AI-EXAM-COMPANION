    "question": "A sum becomes Rs. 6400 in 2 years and Rs. 8000 in 4 years at simple interest. What is the principal?",
    "options": ["2000", "2400", "3000", "3200"],
    "answer": "3200",
    "explanation": "Interest for 2 years = 8000 − 6400 = 1600. So yearly interest = 800. Principal = 6400 − 1600 = 4800? Wait check: Actually SI = P + 2I = 6400 and P + 4I = 8000. Subtract → 2I = 1600 → I = 800. P = 6400 − 1600 = 4800."
