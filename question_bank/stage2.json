    "question": "A train 240 m long crosses a man running at 6 km/h in the opposite direction in 18 seconds. Find the speed of the train.",
    "options": ["42 km/h", "48 km/h", "54 km/h", "60 km/h"],
    "answer": "48 km/h",
    "explanation": "Relative speed = 240/18 = 13.33 m/s = 48 km/h. Since man runs opposite at 6 km/h, actual train speed = 48 - 6 = 42 km/h? No. 13.33 m/s = 48 km/h is total relative speed. Therefore train speed = 48 - 6 = 42 km/h? Correction: 13.33 m/s = 48 km/h. Relative = Train + 6. So Train = 48 - 6 = 42 km/h."
